CV Project

I made this as part of The Odin Project [course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-shopping-cart)

## [Live Preview]("https://itsMe-ThatOneGuy.github.io/shopping-cart")

This is a basic shopping cart system for an online store.

## Getting Started

### Install and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsMe-ThatOneGuy/shopping-cart.git
cd shopping-cart
npm install
npm run start
```

## Built With

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Dev Blog / Post Project Thoughts

This is the rough version of the project, satisfying all of the requirements for this course project.

I would like to later re-style the page to make it look much more professional.
I would also like to restructure how the dollar amounts are stored and manipulated. I feel a better implementation would be to make the currency it's own data structure, storing the dollar amounts and cents as separate key value pairs. That way the amounts could be changed without needing to worry about floating points.

This project allowed me to practice using React Router, and my React skills as a whole.
